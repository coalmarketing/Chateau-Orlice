Enjoy a carefree summer full of adventure, relaxation and discovery. We have prepared a special family package that combines the comfort of Chateau Orlice with a carefully planned programme for every day.

You can look forward to accommodation in spacious rooms, breakfast made from fresh regional ingredients and free access to the hotel spa. Every day you will enjoy a recommended excursion - a romantic boat ride, cycling trails suitable for children or a visit to the water park and fairytale castle in the surroundings.

Treat your family to a summer to remember. Book early - the number of packages is limited.
