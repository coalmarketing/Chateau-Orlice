    - text: At Hotel Chateau Orlice, we also think of our youngest guests. Right next to the hotel there is a cozy playground where children can have hours of fun in the fresh air. They will find a large trampoline for safe jumping and happy laughter, wooden climbing frames that encourage motor skills and imagination, and plenty of space to play and rest.

    - text: The playground is located on the premises, so parents can relax in peace while their children play safely. Whether you are staying with us for the weekend or just coming to our restaurant for lunch, the playground is free for you to use.
