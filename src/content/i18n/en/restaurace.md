  paragraphs:
    - text: In the heart of the Renaissance part of the fortress lies a place where time has stood still – our medieval tavern. Vaulted ceilings, original stone floors and a massive fireplace with an open hearth create a backdrop straight out of ancient times. Here you can experience an atmosphere that awakens the imagination and the taste buds – whether at a feast with food cooked on a plank and beer drawn from a tap, or during a sword fight and performances by wandering artists.

    - text: The tavern is the ideal place for private celebrations, company parties or stylish gatherings with friends. It is open by reservation and always offers a unique and unforgettable evening.
