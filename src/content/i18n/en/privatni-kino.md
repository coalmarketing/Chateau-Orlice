    - text: Experience an enchanting evening where reality and fairy tales meet... Sit at a table floating directly on the surface of the pond and let yourself be carried away by the atmosphere, as if you had just found yourself in the world of the fairy tale The Princess of the Mill. As she walked on the surface of the water, you will feel as if you are floating - far away from the hustle and bustle of the world, surrounded by the silence of nature, the mirror of the surface and the light of the candles.
