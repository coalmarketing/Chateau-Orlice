Sit at a table that floats right on the surface of the pond and let yourself be carried away by the atmosphere as if you had just found yourself in the world of the fairy tale The Princess of the Mill. Just as she walked on the surface of the water, you'll feel like you're floating - away from the hustle and bustle of the world, surrounded by the silence of nature, the mirror of the surface and the light of candles.
